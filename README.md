# Flask Starter Template
This is a starter template for a Flask Python backend that is ready for use in development and production environments with minimal to no configuration.
## Getting Started
You will need to set up a database for this web server template. Ideally, PostgreSQL or MySQL and not SQLite. You will need to have PostgreSQL/MySQL installed in order to install and run the matching Python libraries and instantiate a `db` connection.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
